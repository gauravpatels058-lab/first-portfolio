# 🚀 My First Professional Portfolio
Hi, I'm **Gaurav**! I am a BCA student and an aspiring **Full Stack Developer** (target: June 2027). This project is my first major milestone in web development.

### 🤖 Collaborative Development:
This portfolio was built with the collaborative assistance of **Gemini**, focusing on industry-standard practices, clean code, and logic-building rather than just copy-pasting.

### 🛠️ Tech Stack:
- **HTML5:** Semantic structure for high-quality SEO and accessibility.
- **CSS3:** Advanced Flexbox, CSS Grid, and custom animations.
- **FormSpree:** Fully functional API integration for the contact form.
- **Version Control:** Managed and hosted via **GitHub**.

### 🌟 Key Features:
- **Modern UI:** Dark theme with a professional blue accent.
- **Interactive Elements:** Smooth scrolling, hover animations, and scale effects.
- **Responsive Design:** Optimized for both mobile and desktop screens.
- **Live Functionality:** Direct resume download and real-time email notifications.

### 📈 What I Learned:
Through this project, I mastered the **70/20/10 Rule** of learning: active building, understanding theory, and solving layout problems. I focused on **Clean Code** (meaningful classes) and **Version Control** (Git/GitHub) over academic theory.
